Quiz Game 🧠

This is a dynamic Quiz Game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides an interactive way to test programming knowledge with a variety of question formats.

Key Features:

📝 Multiple Question Types: Supports single-choice, multiple-choice, and text input questions.

⏳ Timer: A 10-minute countdown (600 seconds) adds urgency. The quiz auto-submits when time runs out.

📈 Progress Tracking: A progress bar updates live based on how many questions have been answered.

🧩 Instant Feedback: After submitting, users immediately see their total score and a detailed review.

🌑 Modern UI: A clean, dark-themed interface with a sticky progress bar for better visibility.

⚡ Responsive and Lightweight: Works smoothly across different screen sizes.

How It Works:

Users select answers for each question or type them for text-based inputs.

As answers are selected, the progress bar fills up in real-time.

On submission or timeout, the app checks the answers, calculates the final score, and shows the correct answers for review.

Correct answers are highlighted in green, and incorrect ones in red.

Once submitted, the quiz is locked to prevent multiple attempts.

The project showcases DOM manipulation, event handling, dynamic quiz rendering, real-time updates, and user feedback mechanisms. It’s designed to be simple, fast, and extendable for adding more questions or enhancing functionality.
